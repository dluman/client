# Client

Test a single or series of Python CLI programs all at once!

## Features

Ever needed to test a series of command line scripts with flexible YAML-based arguments? Me neither -- until I did!

Provide a list of Python CLI invocations along with their associated command line arguments in the `config.yaml` (or other `YAML`) file, and go to it!
